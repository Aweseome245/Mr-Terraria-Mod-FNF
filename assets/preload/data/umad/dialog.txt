:dad:Fricking development issues, man
:dad:The fact that the song had to have the space removed is annoying in itself, but here's the thing
:dad:The dev wanted to add a video cutscene here,
:dad:But he couldn't get it working
:dad:There was gonna be an ok looking transition where I removed GF and replaced her with a clone of me for fun
:dad:And I'm still gonna do that, it's just that I can't make it look as cool anymore
:bf:BEEP PO BEEP SKDEP?!
:dad:relax kid, she's still alive, just in another file
:dad:Anyway, I'll do the standard "If you win you get her back"
:dad:Meanwhile the dev will try and get it working at some point
:dad:Anyway, back to your regularly scheduled Friday Night Funkin' gameplay (Now with modcharts!)
